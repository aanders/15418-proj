  <h3>Summary of Present Work Completed</h3>

  <p>Thus far, we have done several things: Created a simple testing harness to generate
  trace files and time our code. Created the base parallel data structure, and began work
  on the sub-structures used by the main one. For a tree, we have implemented a (still
  slightly buggy) RBTree with the added functionality of being able to lookup by the
  index of an element as opposed to its value. Also, we have implemented several versions
  of a sorted array-like structure, one with c++ standard vectors and others with arrays.</p>

  <p>The basic parallel structure uses a lock-free work queue, so that inserts and deletes
  may be performed at a later time by the extra thread. Then, when a lookup is performed,
  the main structure uses the fastest available up-to-date structure (and suspends if none
  are up-to-date).</p>

  <p>With the array-based structure, we have begun working on a version that takes advantage
  of the fact that it does not always need to be up-to-date, saving up operations and then
  performing them in a batch. The jury is out as to the usefulness of this method.</p>

  <h3>Preliminary Results</h3>

  <p>We are still working out bugs in the underlying data structures, so it is difficult to
  tell at this stage how successful this approach will be.  The current data structure is
  roughly 4x slower than a standard red-black tree on small trace files, so our target will
  be at least an equivalent speedup.</p>

  <h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>

  <p>Our main goal is twofold: to make this parallelized data structure useful, but also to
  find out the conditions under which such an approach would be most useful. We doubt we
  will be able to reach the &ldquo;ultimate goal&rdquo; of O(1) time for all operations,
  but still desire to show a noticeable speedup. We intend to show facts and figures at the
  parallelization competition.</p>

  <h3>Concerns</h3>

  <p>Some preliminary testing of an array structure with batched inserts proved worse rather
  than better compared to a similar structure. We have yet to ascertain the reason. Overhead
  costs may be too big a factor. Currently, an implementation based on the C++
  <code>std::vector</code> is much faster than our other array versions (perhaps sticking with
  the vector, already highly optimized code, will prove worthwhile, but it seems like it should
  be possible to make a version which makes better use of the parallelism.)</p>

  <p>As much as anything, time is a big concern: having time enough to test thoroughly and
  respond to tests, figuring out what works well and what doesnâ€™t.</p>
